    index.html: This file contains the HTML structure of the web page. It includes references to React, ReactDOM, Babel for JSX transpilation, and CSS styles.

    index.js: This JavaScript file defines a React component called EditableTable. It handles the rendering of the table and manages the state for data editing.

Functionality:

    The table displays data in rows and columns.
    Each cell of the table is editable, allowing users to input text.
    The component utilizes React's state management to update the table data dynamically.
    When a user types into a cell, the corresponding data in the state is updated.
    Cells with data are visually distinguished from empty cells by background color.
    The first row of the table has a heading spanning all columns, indicating a specific time period ("MONTH 1").
